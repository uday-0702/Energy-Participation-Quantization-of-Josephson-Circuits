# Energy-Participation-Quantization-of-Josephson-Circuits
During my summer break, under the guidance of Dr. Rajeev Singh, I worked on a paper by Zlatko K. Minev, focusing on quantum hardware and devices. The paper introduces the Energy Participation Ratio (EPR) method, which quantizes circuits by analyzing the energy
distribution across elements and explores its application in various devices. My work involved generating EPR-related data for three key devices: Configuration A, B, and Flip-Chip (2.5D) device. The primary goal was to fine-tune a
quantum device to achieve the desired Hamiltonian, Ë†Hfull. Refer full-report [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zdIXOCNhKUA-u7IWLnf8B8hiPjFY4ReB/view?usp=sharing).
